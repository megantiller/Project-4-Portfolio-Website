  <h1>Word Art</h1>
  <p>I hand drew these words as part of an assignment for Typography class.
    The assignment was to make 12 x 18-inch posters for three words of our choice.
    We had to use the definition from a book which included the origin of the word.
    There was no client, message, or audience provided.</p>
  <p>I designed "zombie" based on the concept of blood gushing out from a brain
  after a zombie has ripped it out of a human head and sunk his teeth in it.
  The triangles that make up the letters represent dripping blood.</p>
  <p>Each letter in comedy represents a part of the definition. The "c" represents the island of
  Greece, the ancient land where comedy originated. The "o" represents a
  carousel, the Greece word that makes up a part of the word. The "m" represents
  a staff of music which is read by singers, the other Greece word that makes
  up part of the word. The "e" represents a mime which is an element of a
  Greek religious festival that comedies were featured at. The "d" represents
  eating which is done at the feast held at the end of Greek revels. The "y"
  represents a book because comedies are in literary form.</p>
  <p>"Kibitz" represents a deck of cards because the word originated as a
    person who observes a game of cards. There is a joker card at each end of
    the deck, so the letters at each end of the word represent a joker with
    their jester hat and slippers. Each of the remaining four letters
    represents the four types of cards in a deck - hearts, diamonds, spades,
    and clovers. This is why there are red hearts all over one letter, black
    clovers all over another letter, and etc.</p>
  <p>I made these three pieces for the Art Prof January 2022 Art Dare. Art prof is
  an organization that strives to provide free art education for people of all ages.
  It is run by Clara Lieu, a former adjunct professor of RISD and artist who has won
  several awards. The instructions of the Art Dare were to pick a word from
  any language and create a design of the word that visually conveys the meaning
  of the word.
