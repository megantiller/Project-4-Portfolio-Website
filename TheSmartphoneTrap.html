  <h1>The Smartphone Trap #1 & #2</h1>
  <p>For the Editorial Illustration unit in Illustration, the requirements were
  to choose an editorial article and create an illustration to go along with it.
  I chose "The Smartphone Trap," a guest essay published in The New York Times
  on Sunday, August 1, 2021, by Jonathan Haidt and Jean M. Twenge. It is about
  the negative effects on teenagers of using a phone. In #1, the smartphone
  traps the user in a bubble, isolating her from human connection. In #2, the
  smartphone controls the user like a puppet because the article says too much
  screen time on social media makes teenagers feel bad about themselves when
  they see their peers seemingly picture-perfect lives. Thus, the smartphone
  controls the world they see.</p>
