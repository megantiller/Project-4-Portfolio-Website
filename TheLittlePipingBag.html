  <h1>The Little Piping Bag</h1>
  <p>The assignment was to choose a discipline of illustration and make one page for it. I chose Narrative Illustration, concentrating in Children’s Book Illustration. I used a story I thought of when trying to make creative posts for my Typography class’s Instagram account. My illustration style for the people was inspired by Miko Sato’s, an illustrator I found white completing the research portion of the assignment. Pages 1-9, part 1, are submitted in this portfolio. I made #1 for Illustration class then edited it. I continued and finished Part 1 over Winter Break as a personal project.</p>
