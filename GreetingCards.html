  <h1>Greeting Cards</h1>
  <p>I made these cards for the Hallmark Graphic Design Internship Application.
    I examined Hallmark's collection of Chinese New Year Cards and then tried to
    take a livelier approach. When I was in first grade, I read a book to the
    class where the pig sat in a bath of vegetables and did not know a wolf was
    trying to cook him. I applied this to a turkey. I was trying to think of
    creative concepts. After thinking of several ideas, the idea of a teacher as
    a superhero came to me. I made the bunny one as part of a volunteer project
    hosted at my school on Valentine’s Day. We made cards and care packages for
    sexual abuse survivors. I began the bunny one by finding a line in the
    suggestions for what to write to someone on Valentine's Day on Hallmark’s
    website. I thought something funny would fulfill the goal of giving them a
    lift, so the line about the bunny sounded right. I expanded upon the concept
    by making the bunny show his love by going to where children are drawing
    with chalk to make a heart out of carrots.</p>
