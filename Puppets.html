  <h1>2022 Faculty & Staff Exhibition Takeaways</h1>
  <p>These are ten paper puppets that I made for Graphic Design class in February 2022.
    The perimeters of the assignment were to make takeaways out of paper for
    the schoolâ€™s Annual Art + Design Faculty & Staff Exhibition. I got the idea
    for three finger puppets of the main art professors from a daydream where I
    made a puppet who looked like my professor mock him. I thought if I made a
    puppet that looked like him and made him talk that would be funny. I
    borrowed their structure from a YouTube video on how to make finger puppets
    out of recycled materials. After the class discussion about the projects, I
    decided it would be an even better idea to make puppets out of the work. I
    extended the partial body characters into full bodies. I tried to make the
    style of the face muppet style. I colored them with color pencils. I wanted to make something
    entertaining that people could enjoy and would remind them of the artwork.</p>
