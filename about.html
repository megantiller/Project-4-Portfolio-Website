    <p>[American, 1997-]
    Megan's interest in graphic design began with school yearbook and t-shirt
    design contests. In addition to making work for them, her other hobbies were
    writing music and writing stories. For a while, she aspired to be a Young
    Adult Fiction writer. In high school, she learned Zentangle in a library
    workshop. Then, she drew it on cards for her friends and family. She took
    her first official art class in Fall 2016 where she struggled to make blind
    contour drawings and gesture drawings, but the class connected to her
    abstract sharpie drawing and self-portrait. She decided not to major in art
    the first time around because she though it would be too selfish. Then she
    learned it is okay to follow your dreams and decided to do what makes her
    happy which is making art. She thinks of highly creative graphic design
    ideas and tells stories with illustrations and animations.</p>
