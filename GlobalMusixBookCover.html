  <h1>Global Musix Book Cover</h1>
  <p>For Intro to Graphic Communications class, I had to design book covers.
A faculty member approached my professor, seeking a student to make a book cover
for her Opensource textbook on global music. My professor decided to hold a
contest between the members of the class to determine who gets to design it.
This book cover was one of my strongest ideas.</p>

  <p>I tried to be creative by designing something other than a globe and music notes,
so I centered my idea around headphones. There are two halves of the Earth on
each side of the headphones to relate the drawing to the world. I made the energy
from the music radiate out from the headphones and rise to the top of the page
because I needed to make the composition dynamic. I do not remember how I made
it look loose.</p>
